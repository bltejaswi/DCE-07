<b>Validate the ns-3 implementation of H-TCP</b>
<p>HTCP is a congestion control protocol that is suitable for deployment in high-
speed and long-distance networks.The new protocol, H-TCP, is shown to fair when deployed in
homogeneous networks, to be friendly when competing with conventional TCP sources, to rapidly
respond to bandwidth as it becomes available, and to utilise link bandwidth in an efficient manner.
Further, when deployed in conventional networks, H-TCP behaves as a conventional TCP-variant.</p>
